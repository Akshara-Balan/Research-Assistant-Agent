No relevant research papers were found that specifically match the exact phrase "Explainable AI Revolutionizing Kidney Transplants: Seeing Clearly to Save Lives" on Google Scholar from 2020 to 2025. It's possible that the search term is too specific, or the topic is not widely covered in academic literature during this time period.

* Using broader keywords such as "AI in organ transplant" or "Medical Explainability"
* Checking academic databases such as PubMed, arXiv, or bioRxiv
* Considering related topics such as "Explainable AI in healthcare" or " Medical decision-making with explainable AI"
